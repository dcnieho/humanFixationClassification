% ref and test contain event specifications as a Nx2 matrix, with one row
% per event, the event start indices in the left column and the event end
% index in the right column. Event indices are 1-based.

% logic: We make two vectors indicating for two coders where they set there
% events. We take one as the reference, and the other as the test vector.
% Walk through reference, and see if there is also a fixation in the test
% vector in the same place (i.e, if there is any overlap). If so,
% consume/remove it from both ref and test so that it cannot be used again.
% Count as a hit.
% When we have reached the end of the ref vector, what remains in ref is a
% miss (as it did not also occur in test), and what remains in test is a
% false alarm (as there is nothing there in reference set).
